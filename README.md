### Schedule Generator

This is a special computer program that creates a schedule for a make-believe week with different activities on each day. Let's break it down into simple steps:

1. **Number of Weeks:**
   - The program first decides how many weeks the schedule will cover. In this case, it's set to 6 weeks.

2. **Days of the Week:**
   - The program knows about different days like Monday, Tuesday, and so on.

3. **Bunk Numbers:**
   - There are some special places called "bunks," and each day has its own bunk numbers.

4. **Creating the Schedule:**
   - Using a clever trick, the program arranges these bunks for each day of each week.
   - For example, on Monday of Week 1, you might have Bunk 3. But on Monday of Week 2, it could be Bunk 4, and so on.

5. **Displaying the Schedule:**
   - The program then shows this schedule like a table. On the left, it writes down the week numbers (Week 1, Week 2, etc.).
   - On the top, it lists the days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.).
   - In the middle, it tells you which bunk number you should go to on a particular day of a particular week.

6. **Highlighting Today's Bunk:**
   - Lastly, the program is smart enough to highlight the bunk you should go to today. It uses the current date to figure out which day it is and then highlights the corresponding bunk.

Now, you can use this schedule to know where to go each day and have lots of fun! ðŸŒˆðŸ“…
